# Waste Managment System - UVCE Hackathon
Our waste management system tackles the issue of waste segregation and recycling. The government already collects waste in all cities and towns regularly. But these are being dumped without proper treatment and segregation. 

The different types of waste that are supported in the system are:
1. Recyclable waste: Plastic, Electric devices, Paper, Glass, Metal
2. Non Recyclable wastes: Biodegradable(Food waste or Wet waste) and Non biodegradable(Ceramic, ThermoPlastic, Bulbs)

In total, the system supports 7 types of waste.
